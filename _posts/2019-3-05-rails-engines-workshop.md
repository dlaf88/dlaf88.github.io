Hello, future me, I'm writing this post to remind you how rails engines work.



### A Rails App is a Super-charged engine


You start with a host application: such app can be your run-of-the-mill blogging application. You then add another application to add functionality. When you think of a rails engine you should think of Devise and Thredded. Thredded, for example, allows the main application to use forums.

According to the Rails docs, a rails app inherits "most of its functionality" from Rails::Engine.
